          I'm a Software Engineer with over 10 years of experience, having collaborated on diverse projects spanning digital solutions,
          software development, and IT services. My recent focus has been on JS, React, and React Native, although I'm proficient in PHP,
          MySQL, and various other technologies. Fueled by curiosity, I'm dedicated to discovering creative solutions for project success.

          I enjoy positive collaboration and exchanging experiences with teammates. For me, interactivity is not just work but also fun. In
          my free time, I channel my creativity into game development.
